# ðŸ§± H-Frame Carport Quote Tool

## ðŸ”§ Overview  
A Python-based automation tool developed to streamline the quoting process for H-frame carport solar structures. This tool calculates structural component requirements based on project-specific parameters and outputs a CSV quote file compatible with SAGE Intacct or Excel-based workflows.

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **Inputs:**
  - Panel width and height  
  - Number of panels  
  - Row and bay configuration  
  - Tilt angle, bracing option, spacing type, and end bay preference  

- **Calculates:**
  - Beam lengths and spacing  
  - Purlins, brackets, baseplates, and anchor bolts  
  - End bay adjustments and row layout efficiency  
  - Total number of modules placed based on configuration  

- **Outputs:**
  - Timestamped CSV quote file with detailed bill of materials  
  - CSV is structured for direct import into **SAGE Intacct** or for editing in Excel  

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used  
- Python 3  
- `pandas` â€“ for CSV creation and data handling  
- `math` â€“ for layout and component calculations  
- `datetime` & `os` â€“ for timestamped file generation and organization  

## ðŸ“ˆ Impact  
- Eliminated need for manual BOM calculation in Excel  
- Reduced quoting time from 30â€“60 minutes to under 15 minutes  
- Improved accuracy and consistency of component estimates  
- Enabled sales engineers to handle more quoting requests faster
